🤖 AI Chief of StaffAn intelligent, agentic workflow automation tool that acts as your personal Chief of Staff. It orchestrates Google Calendar, Gmail, and Web Search to manage your daily life using natural language, featuring a Human-in-the-Loop approval system for sensitive actions.🚀 Key FeaturesHierarchical Agent System: Built with LangGraph and LangChain, utilizing a supervisor agent to delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents (Calendar, Email, Web).Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): A robust approval mechanism that pauses execution before sensitive actions (like sending emails), allowing users to review and edit content via the UI before final approval.Natural Language Control: Schedule meetings ("Next Tuesday at 2 PM"), draft emails, and research topics using conversational English.State Persistence: Maintains conversation context and thread history, allowing for multi-turn interactions and "memory" of previous requests.Interactive UI: A clean, responsive frontend built with Streamlit that visualizes agent thought processes and handles approval interruptions seamlessly.🛠️ Tech StackCore Logic: Python, LangGraph, LangChainLLM: Groq (Qwen-32b / Llama-3) for fast inferenceFrontend: StreamlitTools & APIs:Google Calendar APIGoogle Gmail APITavily Search API📂 Project Structure.
