# 🤖 AI Chief of Staff

An intelligent, agentic workflow automation system that acts as a personal **AI Chief of Staff**. This application orchestrates Google Calendar, Gmail, and Web Search using natural language commands, while incorporating a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** approval mechanism for sensitive actions such as email sending. Built using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Streamlit**, the project demonstrates real-world agent orchestration, tool delegation, and human oversight in agentic AI systems.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hierarchical Agent Architecture**  
  Supervisor–worker agent pattern implemented with LangGraph to coordinate multiple specialized agents.

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Approval**  
  Sensitive actions like email sending require explicit user review, editing, and approval before execution.

- **Natural Language Task Execution**  
  Schedule meetings, draft emails, and retrieve web information using conversational English.

- **Interactive Streamlit Interface**  
  Real-time agent streaming, execution status, and approval workflows through a clean UI.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system follows a multi-agent design where a central Supervisor Agent interprets user intent and delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents:

- 📅 **Calendar Agent** – Manages Google Calendar events  
- 📧 **Email Agent** – Drafts and sends Gmail messages with HITL safeguards  
- 🔍 **Web Agent** – Retrieves real-time information using Tavily search  

State is maintained using thread-based conversation tracking with in-memory checkpointing for resumable execution.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher  
- Google Cloud project with Gmail and Calendar APIs enabled  
- OAuth credentials file (`credentials.json`)  
- Groq and Tavily API keys  

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key

## 🧪 Example Capabilities

- Schedule meetings using natural language  
- Draft and send emails with human approval  
- Generate daily briefings from calendar, email, and web data  
- Perform real-time web searches
